			I didn't realize what a great effect technology has on people and social interactions until I took the Technology and You writing class at the University of Rochester. Watching video clips and reading countless articles about how technology effects people really opened my eyes up to see that tech companies have a great influence on the decisions we make and some of our own actions. Reading articles by scholars such as Tristan Harris and Niyal helped me realize that big tech companies influence some of our actions and try to keep us glued to our mobile devices. Technology has such a great effect on people and social interactions, but what many people do not realize is the effect it is having in the work space. The introduction of automation in work spaces has introduced adverse effects on the culture of the work place.

			When automation and other forms of advanced technology were introduced to the office space and the work space, it created a plethora of positive and negative effects. As technology advanced over time and automation was widely used in many aspects of life, extreme amounts of job loss and job displacement followed like ducklings following their mother. While automation and the advancement of technology has contributed to these negative effects, it has also contributed to many positive aspects of the work space and industry. In the past, the introduction of many new technological advances in the work space contributed to a great increase in job loss and the loss of a lot of money because of job displacement. During times such as the industrial revolution, many factory workers lost their jobs because of the introduction of new machines that were more productive than human labor. As a result of this loss of jobs and competition with machines, many people developed computer phobia, or the fear that people would be replaced by computers <a href="https://www.iotforall.com/impact-of-artificial-intelligence-job-losses">(McClelland 2016)</a>. This idea leads to the question: is automation and the advancement of technology going to benefit us in the future or do more harm? Through this blog you will see the advantages and disadvantages of having automation in the work space, and how you can protect yourself from possible competition with these automated machines.

		<h2>
			Automation in the Work Space:
		</h2>

		<p>
			Since the times of the Industrial revolution, automation in the work space has contributed to adverse benefits and negative effects on the work space 	and in the job industry. The introduction of automation had such a negative effect on jobs that a new Act had to be introduced in order to try and salvage resources and to try and improve the economy. That being said, automation has such great power that it can/did directly affect the economy. These effects are even present in the current day where job automation is contributing to an extreme increase in the destruction of jobs in relation to an increase in income inequality and disparities between people <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603465/the-relentless-pace-of-automation/.">(David Rotman)</a>. According to White House reports “less educated workers are more likely to be replaced by automation than highly educated ones. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603465/the-relentless-pace-of-automation/.">(MIT Review 2017)</a>” According to all of these sources and opinions of scholars, there is a strong correlation between automation and a loss of jobs. . As seen in the table, automation has the highest probability of taking the jobs of people who work jobs that require less training and a lower level of education to do.

		<p>
			On the other hand, many researches feel that automation of jobs will have a greater increase of positive effects on jobs and society than negative effects. Many scholars make a point that automation is contributing to an increase in production and even a great benefit to the economy.  The increase of job automation is contributing to a great increase in many positive aspects of the job market as well as the economy. Not only is automation contributing to the new development of jobs, but it is also contributing to better working conditions and many other positive aspects of work. For example, automation is influencing better saving’s costs (100%), giving companies the possibility of higher efficiency (98%), as well as improving conditions for many workers (93%) by reducing the amount of difficult and physical labor in demanding working conditions and allowing robots to take over dangerous tasks to keep employees safe (Frohm J., Lindstrom V., M Winroth, Stahre J., 2006).
		</p>
		<h2>The Solution</h2>
		<p>From the research I have conducted, it is clear to see that automation contributes more positively than negatively to the job market and society. Similar to many other aspects of technology, automation has its benefits and detriments. The only real clear detriment that automation poses to the job market is its correlation with job loss and job displacement.  From all the sources gathered, it is clear to see that scholars revolve around the fact that automation is contributing to job loss, unemployment, job displacement and a loss of money. That is the only real clear connection that automation is having to the job market and society. On the other hand, automation contributes to may positive aspects of the job market and society. For example, automation contributes to the introduction of new job industries, as well as contributing to better working conditions. According to a Deloitte study in the United Kingdom, automation contributed to the loss of jobs of 800,000 low-skilled workers, but contributed to the development of 3.5 million new jobs (Ghafourifar, Alston, and Entefy, VentureBeat 2017). This is evident through the analysis of workers in factories during the industrial revolution compared to workers in the modern day. During the industrial revolution, many workers were injured or killed because of machines and their need for a bit of physical labor. In the modern day, many machines are automated and can be controlled by computer putting workers out of the way of harm. Automation is also contributing to better working conditions by reducing the amount of physical labor and health risks that workers would be exposed to without it. Automation has a plethora of benefits while the detriments of automation are entered around one fixable issue. This issue being unemployment and job displacement. A simple solution that was mentioned by many scholars is the qualification and training of many underqualified and uneducated workers.</p>

		<p>To make sure that you are safe and better able to prevent yourself from losing your job or not being employed, make sure that you're qualified for the job and better educated. Automation is really effecting people who are undereducated and underqualified. College isn't a thing for no reason, so take advantage of it and become better equipped for a good job and a better future. Automation will take jobs that are easy automable such as telemarketing jobs and other as seen in the table shown earlier. Become more competitve and a get a great education as well as experiences. Why not even be the person who programs and creates the automated machines? Last of all,</p>

		<h3>GET QUALIFIED AND GET YOUR MONEY</h3>
